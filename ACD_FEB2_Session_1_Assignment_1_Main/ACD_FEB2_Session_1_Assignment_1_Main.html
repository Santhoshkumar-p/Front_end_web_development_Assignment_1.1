<p> Builder <u> HTML 5 (sample text) </u> </p>
<p>HTML 4.01 is the latest version of HTML. This version is very stable, 
<br>having been released inDecember 1999. Although HTML version 5 (HTML5) 
<br>is in draft stage as of this writing, the specification is probably a 
<br>good year (or so) away from actual release.
</p>
<p> For Styles <i> CSS (sample text) </i> </p>
<p>The latest CSS version is 2.1. Although version 3.0 is in development, its release might still be
<br>years away. Therefore, this book concentrates on CSS 2.1 due to its maturity. CSS version 2.0
<br>has been around for almost a decade, is used for millions of Web pages, and is well understood
<br>by most Web designers. CSS version 2.1 combines some bug fixes, exact specifications where
<br>there was some ambiguity, and a few more properties and values. At its core, however, it is very
<br>much like version 2.0.
</p>
<p> Third <b> Web 2.0 (sample text) </b> </p>
<p>In 2004, a new World Wide Web was heralded: ‘‘Web 2.0.’’ This new age of the Web was to
<br>facilitate interactive information sharing, interoperability, user-centered design, and collaboration.
<br>In the next few years several outlets for this new frontier were born. They included blogs,
<br>web-based communities, hosted services, and a bevy of social-networking and collaborative
<br>sites. It seemed as though the new Web was coming into its own. Except, this new Web was
<br>nothing new.
